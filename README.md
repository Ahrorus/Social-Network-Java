## Social Network console application based on Java.
> This application was done with collaboration of George Korolev as a Data Structures Java project for De Anza college Data Sructures class. You can create a new profile, login to your account, modify your status, search people, and add friends.

> The application uses Hashmaps to store created profiles and Graph to store connections between friends. When the application is closed from the console, it serializes objects and stores them in the disk.
